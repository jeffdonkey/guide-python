SPECIAL METHODS

Special Methods are exclusive to Python Classes.  They are also known as "Magic" methods or "Dunder" methods.

Syntax:

def __<identifier>__(argument):


Examples:

    def __init__(self):         argument 'initializer' found at the beginning of Python Classes
    def __str__(self):          return is a 'string'
    def __lt__(self, other):    "<", less than. Return is a boolean.
    def __ne__(self,other):     "!=", not equal. Return is a boolean.
